This project has implementations of Classification models:

	* SVM
	* SVM-Stochastic Gradient along with Animation
	* LSTM Model
	* Naive Bayes
	* Density Estimation
	* Visulaization methods : PCA, MCA, T-SNE


This project was part of classification of articles based on Tags generated. To generate Tags other models were used. 

Notes: 

	For neural network simple sequential model has been used (1-by-1) as there was no relation between itera-tags. But one 	       can modify this model to use it for (n-by-1) models to use it for Sentence genaration.
